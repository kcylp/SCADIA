## 🚀 Live Demo
Here is a [live demo](https://kcylp.github.io) example of SCADIA editor.

## 📚 Documentation

Official documentation is available at:

👉 https://kcylp.github.io/SCADIA/

The documentation source is located in the `/docs` directory of this repository.

The site is built using MkDocs (Material theme) and automatically deployed via GitHub Actions.

## 🛠 Installing and Running
SCADIA is developed with NodeJS (backend) and Angular (frontend).

For detailed guides and advanced configuration options, see the official documentation:

👉 https://kcylp.github.io/SCADIA/


### 1° Option - Running from docker
```
docker pull kcylp/scadia:latest
docker run -d -p 1881:1881 kcylp/scadia:latest

// persistent storage of application data (project), daq (tags history), logs and images (resource)
docker run -d -p 1881:1881 -v scadia_appdata:/usr/src/app/SCADIA/server/_appdata -v scadia_db:/usr/src/app/SCADIA/server/_db -v scadia_logs:/usr/src/app/SCADIA/server/_logs -v scadia_images:/usr/src/app/SCADIA/server/_images kcylp/scadia:latest

// with Docker compose
// persistent storage will be at ./appdata ./db ./logs and ./images
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kcylp/SCADIA/master/compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Open up a browser (better Chrome) and navigate to http://localhost:1881

### 2° Option - Install from source
[Download the latest release](https://github.com/kcylp/SCADIA/releases) and unpack it

You need to have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)
- Recommended: Node.js 18 LTS

**Note** Starting from SCADIA 1.2.7, Node.js 14 and older versions are not supported due to upstream dependency updates.

**WARNING** On Linux systems (especially Raspberry Pi), installing native dependencies with Node.js 18 may require additional build tools.
If you do not intend to use specific features, you can safely remove them from ```server/package.json```:
- Remove ```node-snap7``` if you do not need Siemens S7 communication
- Remove ```odbc``` if you do not need external database connectivity

```
cd ./server
npm install
npm start
```

Open up a browser (better Chrome) and navigate to http://localhost:1881

### 3° Option - Install from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kcylp/scadia)

You need to have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)
- Recommended: Node.js 18 LTS

**WARNING** In linux with nodejs Version 18 the installation could be a challenge.
If you don't intend communicate with Siemens PLCs via S7 (node-snap7 library) you can install from [NPM @kcylp/scadia-min](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kcylp/scadia-min)

```
npm install -g --unsafe-perm @kcylp/scadia
scadia
```

Open up a browser (better Chrome) and navigate to http://localhost:1881

### 4° Option - Install using prebuilt Electron Packages

You will need to be logged into github to access the download button for Electron Action Builds,
click on the workflow and scroll down to Artifacts and click the download icon for you system

[Electron Action Builds](https://github.com/kcylp/SCADIA/actions/workflows/electron_latest.yml)

<img width="2082" height="531" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40f01e1d-cf39-4145-99a0-e8fedf791edf" />

### 5° Option - Headless Portable Binaries for Embedded Devices

For headless deployments on embedded devices or servers without GUI, SCADIA provides self-contained portable binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

These binaries include everything needed (server, client) and run as standalone executables.

Download the latest builds from GitHub Actions artifacts:

[Headless Portable Builds](https://github.com/kcylp/SCADIA/actions/workflows/headless_packaging.yml)

For detailed installation and running instructions, see the documentation.

### Creating the Electron Application
Electron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies. An Electron application is standalone, meaning it can be run independently on your desktop without needing a web browser.

To create the Electron application, you need to have node.js 18 installed. Follow these steps:

Build Server and Client First
```
cd ./server
npm install
cd ../client
npm install
npm run build
```

Packaging
```
cd ./app
npm install
npm run package
```

After following these steps, you will have a standalone Electron application for SCADIA. The application can be found in the ./app directory.
